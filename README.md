# Excel-VBA-Minesweeper
An implementation the popular game Minesweeper using Excel and VBA. The aim of the game is to find and correctly mark all the mines in the grid, without accidentally tripping any of the mines. To mark/unmark a cell, right click the cell. To clear a cell, double click it. Correctly clearing cells (ie double clicking on cells which donâ€™t contain mines) will result in one of two outcomes: i) if the cell is adjacent to a mine/multiple mines, it will display a number between 1 and 8 representing the number of mines it is adjacent to, and a corresponding color ii) if the cell is not adjacent to any mines, it will change color (grey to purple), and trigger a recursive call to check adjacent cells. Players win when all mines are marked, and will likewise lose if they double click mines.
